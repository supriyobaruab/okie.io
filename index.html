          <h3>Where all the crazy people are gathered</h3>
          <p>
            The okie group was formed in the early days of elementary school
            when a group of twelve children from the same neighborhood and
            school began to bond over shared interests and adventures. Their
            connection was instantaneous, marked by a collective love for
            imaginative play, outdoor exploration, and creative projects.
