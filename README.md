# Okie Group

### History

The **okie group** was formed in the early days of elementary school
when a group of sixteen children from the same neighborhood and
school began to bond over shared interests and adventures. Their
connection was instantaneous, marked by a collective love for
imaginative play, outdoor exploration, and creative projects.
